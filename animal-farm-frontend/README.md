# Animal Farm Web Application

A satirical web application based on George Orwell's "Animal Farm". This application allows users to interact with various animals from the story and features a central pig figure that responds to user actions.

## Features

- Interactive animal cards with feeding functionality
- Animated central pig figure that responds to interactions
- Thank you counter for each animal
- Easter egg features with sound effects
- Responsive design using Angular Material

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `ng serve` for a dev server
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Built With

- Angular
- Angular Material
- TypeScript

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
